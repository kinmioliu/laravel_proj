<h1>my fourth post</h1>
<p>
    Then at the maintenance period(2016.7~), I response for the latence problem of R1, during this period, I system learning about the MIT frame, and create many wiki, such as how to solve sys err problem, which is the most famous and serious problem in my domain, and the performance problem after 9800 product support low level sncp feature, the main reason is that we use mit frame, with more and more capacity, the sncp count will become very large, so the mit node that support sncp will become very large amount, espasually in the startup period, it will cause soft dog. In the host switch, it will cause soft dog, and so on, I solved one famous problem by delete one line code improve great performance.
